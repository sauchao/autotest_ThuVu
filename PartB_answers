Part B of helloPay QA auto exercise's answer:

What is the benefit of automation test and why? Please provide some of your examples to explain that
Some of the benefits of automation test are:
- Running tests 24/7: can be run over night, weekend, holiday, etc.
- Fewer human resources for manual testing
- Reusability: scripts are reusable over browsers, Operating Systems, builds, etc.
- Simultaneity: can run test on multiple devices, browsers, OS, etc. simultaneously
- Volume: can be run for a large number of test cases/ users/ devices while manually would be impossible
- Reliability: human errors may happens when running boring repetitive standardized tests but not happens with automated testing

What makes a good automation test tool, and what is a bad one? Why?
This depends on the situation of the team whether an automation test tool is good or bad and suitable to the team or not. 
Some considerable criteria such as: 
- Whether we have skilled resource to allocate for automation tasks or not? 
- Whether we have enough budget? 
- What are our testing needs? Is it suitable for the project environment and technology we are using (such as web app, mobile app, etc.)?
- Is it support for all of our expected testing types (Unit, functional, regression etc.)? 
- Does it integrate well with our other testing tools like project planning and test management tools?
- etc.
Then we may consider some other criteria such as: easy/simple interface to create and maintain test scripts, powerful reporting with graphical interface, customer support ability, etc.
